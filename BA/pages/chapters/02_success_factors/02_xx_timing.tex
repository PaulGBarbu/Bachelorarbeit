        An interesting point made in Malcolm Gladwells book Outliers: The Story of Success [24] is that people
        are successful if their skills support products in a marketplace that is just maturing and where there is,
        consequently, still little competition. The same is certainly true for open source software projects as well:
        Projects that pick up a trend too late will have a difficult time thriving in a market that already supports other,
        large and mature projects
